NginZ
==========

NginZ is a scalable application server. It is useful for instant messaging and audio/video communication.

Note
====

Please update the port in `inc/nginz_config.h` to the appropriate value.

Requirements
============

NginZ depends on the following packages,

- automake
- libtool
- pkg-config
- [Aroop Core](https://github.com/kamanashisroy/aroop_core)
- libmemcached(not needed anymore)

It it tested in Linux platform.

Building
========

The compilation command is. `./autogen.sh;make;make install;`

And the output binary is `nginz_main`, `nginz_main_debug`.

Features
========

NginZ is equiped to serve as communication applications. It has,

- [Plugin](base/plugin.md) and dependency injection.
- Parallel processing support based on [line-topology, token-passing and pipeline pattern](base/src/parallel/pipeline.c). [This is elaborated in great details by the networking scenarios here.](base/parallel.md).
- It has scalability features. The requests are load-balanced in the worker processes.
- It has [memory profiler](chat/src/profiler.c).
- It has [event-loop](base/src/event_loop.c) module to handle user data in [fibers](base/src/fiber.c).
- It has [command shell](base/src/shake.c) to diagnose the server.
- Writing new feature for chat server needs very less code(see the following ..). 
- It has an HTTP interface(It is useful for benchmarking).
- It has [streamio](net/src/streamio.c) which supports io chaining. It is useful to implement proxy-pattern and chain-of-responsiblity pattern. The chat server is tunneled through http protocol using this feature.

Dependency injection
====================

As a framework it supports dependency injection by plugin-spaces/extension-points. It makes less coupling and strong cohesion possible. And the result is less code and easily maintainable source for each features.

Webchat
========
The nginz http uses session to tunnel state-ful chat server.

The [web-chat live demo prototype is available here](http://ec2-54-191-149-216.us-west-2.compute.amazonaws.com/pagechat).

Command shell
=============

```
socat - UNIX-CLIENT:/tmp/nginz.sock
help
plugin	shake	shake/plugin	src/plugin_manager.c
It dumps the avilable plugins
....
```

Benchmarking
============

I did benchmarking with [10K concurrency and 1 Million requests](BENCHMARKING.md). 

I did benchmarking in the localhost with 10K concurency.

```
ab -r -n 100000 -c 10000 http://localhost:80/

The result shows it can handle concurrent request. And the processor usage is uniform.

For server crash, use

```
addr2line -e ./nginz_main_debug ip
```
