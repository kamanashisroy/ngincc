Parallel processing
===================

The parallelism achieved by this module is process based rather than thread-based. So there is no memory sharing. The processes communicate with each other through sockets.

This module facilitates parallel communication over processes. The processes form a star topology. The master process stays in the middle. They communicate over unix socket by token passing.

Note that the design is event based. So all the actions start from the `event_loop.hxx`. Eventually the `event_loop.hxx` is executed by the `worker.cc` which facilitates co-operative non-preemptive multitasking.

### Master and Worker

The network stacks are implemented by master listener process and child workers. The child workers load-balance the connections among them. The socket connections literally jumps from one worker process to another. This jumping is supported by linux implementation of [sendmsg and recvmsg](http://linux.die.net/man/2/sendmsg). 

#### Serving an http request scenario ..

Here the master process accepts the user tcp connection(request level). It then sends the socket to the worker(background) process.

The diagram below shows how the worker(task level) process responds user request.

Compare and Swap database
==========================

There is a compare and swap database available. It can be used to set a key,value pair accross all the processes. Please see the `async\_db.c` for the implementation details.
